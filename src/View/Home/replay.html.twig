            Again, you were right to trust yourself!
            By skillful techniques, you sneak through the streets neither seen nor known, booty in hand.
            It is a stone's throw from your home that, once the tension has dropped, a police car stops in front of you.
            No chance for them to suspect the larceny committed but .. no certificate!
            And that's how, just as great as you are, you end up getting embarked by the police (it's not fun with the
            Covid in New York)!
            But, after all, youâ€™ll probably do better next time.
